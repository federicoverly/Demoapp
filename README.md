# ESV Test

ESV Test app created with React JS and typescript. It follows the requirements:

Demo Shopping Cart Application

Right side of the screen:
Show an editable text area field, where the user can enter a comma separated list of products with the following pattern:
eg. "apple, 4, banana, 6.2, strawberry, 2"

Show an equal number of Item Buttons that each add one of the products to the shopping cart on the left side.
The prices are given as the numbers after each product list item.
Eg the product "apple" costs 4 and the "banana" product costs 6.2

If the user changes the list in the text area, the shown buttons adapt.

Left side of the screen:

After clicking one of the product buttons, the corresponding product is shown in a list (our simplified shopping cart).
The list items should show a quantity, the name of the added item, the unit price, the total price (= quantity \* unit price)
Eg clicking a product button multiple times should add 1 to the product quantity and total price is recalculated.

A delete button is shown next to every item that removes the item from the basket.

Below the list is a summary line that shows the number of items in the cart and the grand total price.
